* coldnew's Sabayon Linux repository

This is my personal's sabayon linux repository, feel free to use it :)

* Add this repo to your Sabayon Linux

To use this binary host, you can use following command to add it to your Sabayon Linux system:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  equo repo add coldnew \
       --desc "coldnew's Sabayon Linux Repository" \
       --repo https://coldnew.github.io/sabayon-coldnew/#bz2  \
       --pkg https://coldnew.github.io/sabayon-coldnew/
#+END_SRC

then update the entropy info

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  equo update
#+END_SRC

* How to create repo like this one ?

Here are some info how I create this repo

** Install sys-apps/entropy-server

   We need to install entropy-server first

   : equo install sys-apps/entropy-server

** Edit /etc/entropy/server.conf

   You can create the =/etc/entropy/server.conf= from =/etc/entropy/server.conf.example=.

   : cp /etc/entropy/server.conf.example /etc/entropy/server.conf

   If you want your repo just an overlay, you need to setup this

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # Community repository mode, enable this if your repositories
     # are just "overlays" of other full-blown repositories.
     # For example, you're providing your own set of customized packages
     # that are meant to work with some distribution repositories' packages.
     #
     # syntax for community-mode:
     #    community-mode = <enable/disable>
     #    default is: disable
     #
     community-mode = enable
   #+END_SRC

   You also need to modify you default repository name (ex: =coldnew=)

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     #  syntax for default-repository:
     #
     #    default-repository: Currently working repository identifier (if you have
     #        more than one server-side repository, this indicates the one which
     #        Entropy Server is authorized to work on)
     #    default-repository = <repository identifier>
     #
     default-repository = coldnew
   #+END_SRC

** Edit /etc/entropy/repositories.conf.d/

   You need to add you repository info in =/etc/entropy/repositories.conf.d/=, take my repo for example, I need to create =entropy_coldnew= with following contents:

   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
     # Repository configuration file automatically generated
     # by Entropy on your behalf.

     [coldnew]
     desc = coldnew's Sabayon Linux Repository
     repo = file:///w/binhost/sabayon-coldnew/
     enabled = true

     pkg = https://coldnew.github.io/sabayon-coldnew/
   #+END_SRC

** Initialize you repository

   Just switch to your repository dir (change =coldnew= to you repository name)

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     eit init coldnew
   #+END_SRC

** Use portage build the package

   Just use portage build the package you need, note that I use =-B= to make portage just build the package and not install to system.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     emerge -avB dev-embedded/stlink
   #+END_SRC

   After package builded, you can find the package locate in =/usr/portage/packages/dev-embedded/stlink-1.2.0.tbz2=, we need to transfer it to Sabayon's package.

** Transfer portage package to entropy one

   Let's create a tmp directory =/tmp/packages=

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mkdir -p /tmp/packages
   #+END_SRC

   It's time to transfer portage package to entropy package

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     equo pkg inflate --savedir /tmp/packages /usr/portage/packages/dev-embedded/stlink-1.2.0.tbz2
   #+END_SRC

** Add the package to you repo

   Now, there's are some new package in you =/tmp/packages= directory, juse add them to your repo

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     eit inject /tmp/packages/dev-embedded/dev-embedded:stlink-1.2.0.998e8a33fb4db7a3a016e6c741c7512101655adc~9999.tbz2
   #+END_SRC

** Push all changes

   After all things done, you can push all your modification to your repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     eit push
   #+END_SRC
